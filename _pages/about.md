Muhammed N. Sahvelet is a PhD student in Hydraulics and Hydrology at Purdue University under the supervision of Dr. Cary D. Troy. His research focuses on nearshore wave transformation, longshore sediment transport, and coastal morphodynamics in the Great Lakes.

His current work includes the development of a basin-scale Potential Longshore Sediment Transport Atlas for Lake Michigan using WIS hindcast data and numerical wave transformation methods. Additional interests include Boussinesq-type modeling, diffraction analysis, and coastal vulnerability assessment.
