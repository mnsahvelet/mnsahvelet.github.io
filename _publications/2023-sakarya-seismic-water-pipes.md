### Abstract (English)

Following the 1999 Marmara earthquake, substantial damage occurred in parts of the drinking water distribution network in Sakarya Province, while the wastewater network became nearly inoperable. This study evaluates the seismic vulnerability of buried drinking water pipelines, which form a major component of Sakarya’s water supply and distribution infrastructure, using the Hazards US (HAZUS) methodology.

Peak ground velocity values used in the vulnerability assessment were estimated through classical probabilistic seismic hazard analysis. Soil classes adopted in the damage analyses were computed using seismic data from 2,044 locations across the province. A province-wide drinking water pipeline inventory was compiled, and vulnerability parameters were assigned to individual pipeline segments using geographic information systems.

The analyses produced repair rate ratios that quantify expected seismic damage for all pipelines, and pipeline segments were classified based on these repair rate levels.
