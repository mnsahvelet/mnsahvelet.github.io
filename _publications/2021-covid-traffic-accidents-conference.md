### Abstract

This study investigates the indirect impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on traffic accident rates. With the implementation of mobility restrictions, lockdown measures, and reduced transportation demand during the pandemic period, significant changes were observed in traffic volume and accident statistics.

Using comparative statistical analysis, traffic accident data from pre-pandemic and pandemic periods were evaluated to determine the extent of reduction in accident frequency and severity. The findings indicate that mobility restrictions led to a measurable decrease in traffic accidents, highlighting an unintended but positive societal outcome of the pandemic response measures.

The study contributes to understanding the relationship between mobility patterns, emergency management policies, and traffic safety, and provides insights for future disaster and crisis-related transportation planning.
