### Abstract

This study evaluates structural earthquake vulnerability levels of the building stock in Tığcılar Neighborhood of Adapazarı, Sakarya Province, located within an active seismic zone. A simplified, observation based vulnerability assessment method described in the implementing regulation of the Law on Transformation of Areas under Disaster Risk (No. 6306) was transferred into the ArcGIS “Collector” web workflow to support field data acquisition and GIS based analysis.

Buildings were assigned an initial performance score, and risk increasing structural irregularities, including short columns, soft stories, heavy overhangs, and story height irregularities, were identified during field surveys. The negative contribution of these factors was deducted from the initial score to obtain building performance scores for the entire inventory.

Vulnerability levels were determined statistically using the arithmetic mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) of performance scores. “High” and “very high” vulnerability classes were identified for buildings with scores below (μ − σ), while “medium” and “low” classes were associated with higher score ranges. The results provide a GIS enabled framework for rapid screening of regional building vulnerability and can support earthquake risk mitigation planning.
